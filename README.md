# HESRT
Health Economic Services for RadiotTherapy

Health Economics Services for RadioTherapy (HESRT) is a repository of r-scripts and documentation on health economics to help decision-making related to the use of radiotherapy in the management of cancer. The information contained in HESRT can be used in any income or regional setting, but is intended to help decision-making in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) 

Health economic evaluation studies are used in public health to assess health strategies/interventions in terms of their cost-effectiveness and inform public policies. Health economic evaluation does not substitute but rather complement the evidence-based medicine paradigm for decision making in public health.
